### 1. Create a conda environment

This pipeline will process data from Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit (10X Genomics) using Seurat v4 and Cell Ranger v6.1.

A conda environment for the analysis can be created as follows:
```bash
conda create -n scRNA -c conda-forge r-base r-essentials
conda install -n scRNA -c r r-irkernel
conda install -n scRNA -c bioconda r-seurat
```

You can install the latest version of Cell Ranger. To install Cell Ranger, you will need to register at [this link](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest). 

Create a folder to save the new CellRanger code, `cd` and run the `wget` or `curl` command provided following the registration. 

```bash
tar -zxvf cellranger-6.1.2.tar.gz
```
Next add the path with the CellRanger executable to your PATH. **NOTE: you will have to run this command every time you want to use CellRanger**.
```bash
export PATH=/rds/general/user/hm1412/home/anaconda3/envs/scRNA2/bin/cellranger-6.1.2:$PATH
```

The first steps will follow the recommended pipeline from [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/tutorial_ov).
First, trim align fastq files to the reference genome (GRCh38).


```R

```

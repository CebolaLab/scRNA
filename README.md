### 1. Installations

This pipeline will process data from Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit (10X Genomics) using Seurat v4 and Cell Ranger v6.1.

A conda environment for the analysis can be created as follows:
```bash
conda create -n scRNA -c conda-forge r-base r-essentials
conda install -n scRNA -c r r-irkernel
conda install -n scRNA -c bioconda r-seurat
```

You can install the latest version of Cell Ranger. To install Cell Ranger, you will need to register at [this link](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest). 

Create a folder to save the new CellRanger code, `cd` and run the `wget` or `curl` command provided following the registration. 

```bash
tar -zxvf cellranger-6.1.2.tar.gz
```
Next add the path with the CellRanger executable to your PATH. **NOTE: you will have to run this command every time you want to use CellRanger**.
```bash
export PATH=/rds/general/user/hm1412/home/anaconda3/envs/scRNA2/bin/cellranger-6.1.2:$PATH
```

### 2. Generate a reference transcriptome

The first steps will follow the recommended pipeline from [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/tutorial_ov).

`cellranger count` will require a transcriptome reference. You can download the prebuilt reference. However, here we will compile our own using our preferred versions of the reference genome and gene annotation:

```bash
# Genome metadata
genome="GRCh38"
version="2021-Mar"

# Set up source and build directories
build="GRCh38-gencode_v36_build"
mkdir -p "$build"

fasta_in=GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna
gtf_in=gencode.v36.annotation.gtf

# Create reference package
cellranger mkref --ref-version="$version" --genome="$genome" --fasta="$fasta_in" --genes="$gtf_in"
```

### 3. Cellranger count

To run `cellranger count`, make sure your files are in the `bcl2fastq` naming convention e.g. SRR10009414_S1_L00X_R1_001.fastq.gz (and the corresponding R2). 


```R

```
